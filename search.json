    "text": "The General Form of a Simple Program\nA basic C program follows the following form:\ndirectives\n\nint main(void)\n{\n  statements\n}\nThe simplist C programs rely on three language features:\n\nDirectives: Editing commands that modify the program prior to compilation\nFunctions: Named blocks of executable code (e.g. main)\nStatements: Commands to be performed when the program is run\n\n\nDirectives\nBefore a C program is complied, it is edited by the preprocessor. - Commands for the preprocessor are called directives\nThe punc.c program begins with:\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nThis directive states that the information in &lt;stdio.h&gt; is to be included in the program before it is compiled.\n\n&lt;stdio.h&gt; contains information about the standard I/O library.\nC has a number of these headers as there are no built-in commands for things like read/write.\n\nDirectives always begin with a # character\nBy default, they are one line long, without a semicolon at the end.\n\n\n\nFunctions\nFunctions are procedures/subroutines that are the building blocks from which programs are built. Functions fall into two categories: - Written by the programmer - Provided by C (library functions)\nIn C, a function is a series of statements that are group together and given a name.\n\nSome compute values\nSome return values using the return statement.\n\nAll C programs are required to have the main function.\n\nmain is a function, which can also return a value.\n\nLooking at the `pun.c program:\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n  print(\"To C, or not to C: That is the question. \\n\");\n  return 0;\n}\n\nint indicates that main will return an integer value.\nvoid indicates that main has no arguments.\nreturn 0 has two effects:\n\nCauses main to terminates\nIndicates that main returns the value 0\n\nIf there is no return statement, the program will still terminate, but the compiler may throw a warning.\nStatements\nA statement is a command to be executed when the program runs.\nThe pun.c program has two kinds of statements: return and the function call\nA function performing an assigned task is calling the function.\nC requires each statement to end with a semicolon.\n\nA compound statement, doesn’t require a semicolon.\nThe semicolon tells the compiler where the statement ends."

    "section": "Variables and Assignment",
    "text": "Variables and Assignment\nEvery variable must have a type, which is the kind of data it will hold.\n\nChoosing the proper type is critical because operations are different depending on the variable’s type.\nIntegers for example, can only go up to 2.1M,\nfloat numbers stores more digits as well as numbers after the decimals.\n\nThe down side is that float are slower for arithmetic and the value tends to have a rounding error (e.g 0.1 could be 0.0999..)\n\n\n\nDeclarations\nVariables must be declared for the compiler, before they are used.\n\nTo declare a variable, first specify the type and then it’s name (e.g. int height;).\nIf several variables have the same type, they can be declared at once:\n\nint height, length, width, volume;\nfloat profit, loss;\n\nDeclarations always end with a semicolon.\n\nWhen main contains declarations, they must be preceded by statements:\nint main(void)\n{\n  declarations\n  statments\n}\n\nIn C99, declarations don’t have to come before statements.\n\nmain might contain a declaration, then statement, then another declaration.\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nA variable can be given a value through assignment:\nheight = 8;\nlength = 12;\nwidth = 10;\nIn general, the right side of of an assignment can be a formulate (expression) involving constants, variables, and operators.\n\n\nPrinting the value of a variable\nprintf(\"Height: %d\\n\", height);\n\n%d is a placeholder for height\n\nBy default, %f displays a number with 6 digits after the decimal point\nTo force %f to display p digits after the decimal point, we can put .p between the % and the f:\n\n\nprintf(\"Profit: $%.2f\\n\", profit)\n\n\nInitialization\nSome variables are automatically set to zero when the program begins, but most are not. - A variable that doesn’t have a default value or is assigned one, is said to be uninitialized\nNOTE: If we try to access the value of an uninitialized variable, it is likely to return a random value such as 2567, -30891, or some other random number. - It’s also possible that it crashes the program.\nWe can declare the variable height and initialize it in one step:\nint height = 8;\n\nThe value 8 is said to be an initializer\n\nMultiple variables can be initialized in the same declaration:\nint height = 8, length = 12, width = 10;\n\nEach variable requires its own initializer."

    "text": "Reading Input\nscanf, the counterpart of printf can be used to read inputs.\n\nThe f in scanf/readf stands for “formatted” as both require the use of a format string to specify the appearance of the input or output data.\nscanf needs to know what kind of input data will be entered and printf needs to know how to display the output data.\n\nFor example, reading an int value:\nscanf(\"%d, &i\"); /* reads an integer; stores into i */\n\n%d tells scanf to read the input that represents an integer.\ni is an int variable where scanf will store the input."
