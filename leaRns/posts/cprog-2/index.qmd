## Writing a simple program

First program:

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  print("To C, or not to C: That is the question.\n");
  return 0;
}
```

-   The `#include <stdio.h>`includes information from C's standard I/O library.
-   The executable portion of the code goes into `main`
-   `printf` comes from the stdio
-   `return  0;` returns the value 0 to the operating system when the program terminates.

### Compiling and linking

Before the program can run we have three steps:

1.  **Preprocessing** - The program is given to the [preprocessor](.underline) which follows the commands that begin with `#` (directives).
    -   The preprocessor can add/modify the program
2.  **Compliling** - The modified program from the preprocessor goes to the [compiler](.underline), which translates it to machine instructions (object code)
3.  **Linking** - A [linker](.underline) combines the object code with any necessarily additional code (e.g. functions from a library) that are used in the program.

We can compile the code in terminal by navigating to the folder and running:

```         
cc pun.c
```

-   This creates a file `a.out`, which is an executable that can be run (default)

We could specify the name of the output file if we did:

```         
cc -o pun pun.c
```

-   This produces `pun.out`

The `a.out` file can be run with the following in terminal:

```         
./a.out
```
### The General Form of a Simple Program
A basic C program follows the following form:
```c
directives

int main(void)
{
  statements
}
```

The simplist C programs rely on three language features:

- **Directives**: Editing commands that modify the program prior to compliation
- **Functions**: Named blocks of executable code (e.g. `main`)
- **Statements**: Commands to be performed when the program is run

#### Directives
Before a C program is complied, it is edited by the preprocessor.
- Commands for the preprocessor are called directives

The `punc.c` program begins with:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
```
- This directive states that the informatoin in `<stdio.h>` is to be included in the program before it is compiled.
  - `<stdio.h>` contains infomration about the standard I/O library.
  - C has a number of these **headers** as there are no built-in commands for things like read/write.
- Directives always begin with a # character
- By default, they are one line long, without a semicolon at the end.

#### Functions
**Functions** are procedures/subroutines that are the building blocks from which programs are built. Functions fall into two categories:
- Written by the programmer
- Provided by C (**library functions**)

In C, a function is a series of statements that are group together and given a name. 
- Some compute values
- Some return values using the `return` statement.

All C programs are required to have the `main` function.
- `main` is a function, which can also return a value.

Looking at the `pun.c program:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  print("To C, or not to C: That is the question. \n");
  return 0;
}
```
- `int` indicates that `main` will return an integer value.
- `void` indicates that `main` has no arguments.
- `return 0` has two effects:
  - Causes `main` to terminates
  - Indicates that `main` returns the value 0

  If there is no `return` statement, the program will still terminate, but the compiler may throw a warning.

  #### Statements
  A **statement** is a command to be executed when the program runs.
  
  The `pun.c` program has two kinds of statements: 
  `return` and the **function call**
 
 - A function performing an assigned task is **calling** the function.
  - C requires each statement to end with a semicolon.
    - A compound statment, doesn't require a semicolon.
    - The semicolon tells the compiler where the statement ends.

### Comments
The original comment syntax `/* This is a comment */`

- These are essentially block quotes until there's a closing `*/`

With C99, we can use `//`, which is just for a single line.

### Variables and Assignment
Every variable must have a **type**, which is the kind of data it will hold.

- Chosing the proper type is critical because operations are different depending on the variable's type.
- Integers for example, can only go up to 2.1M, 
- `float` numbers stores more digits as well as numbers after the decimals.
  - The down side is that float are slower for arithmetic and the value tends to have a rounding error (e.g 0.1 could be 0.0999..)

#### Declarations
Variables must be **declared** for the complier, before they are used. 

- To declare a variable, first specify the *type* and then it's name (e.g. `int height;`).
- If several variables have the same type, they can be declared at once:
```c
int height, length, width, volume;
float profit, loss;
```
- Declarations always end with a semicolon. 

When `main` contains declarations, they must be preceded by statements:
```c
int main(void)
{
  Declarations
  statments
}
```
